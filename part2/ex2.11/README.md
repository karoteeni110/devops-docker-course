# Use Pyspark + graphframe from Jupyter Lab

Usage:

```
docker compose up
```

When the Jupyter server sets up at port 8888 (mapped to local), we should see something like:

```
ex211-pyspark-notebook-1  |     To access the server, open this file in a browser:
ex211-pyspark-notebook-1  |         file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-7-open.html
ex211-pyspark-notebook-1  |     Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
ex211-pyspark-notebook-1  |         http://e214c2515bc2:8888/lab?token=SOMETOKEN
ex211-pyspark-notebook-1  |      or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=SOMETOKEN
```

Click the URL to access the server. Use notebooks like `graphframe-hello-world.ipynb` from there.
